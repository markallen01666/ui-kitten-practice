++ UI Kitten React Native Framework - practice app

I experimented with UI KItten for React Native. While there could be many positives from using this UI, while following the official guide I encountered a number of errors caused by out of date configurations. I worked through a number of them but continued to encounter more errors, so I've abandoned this at the moment.

Many of the errors encountered correlated to error reports from late 2019. I was trying to use this framework in January 2020, so it may just be that over the holiday period no bug fixes occurred. I will revisit this framework at a later date to see if the issues have been resolved.
